# winship-demo
A tool that evaluates the potential of a WINd-assisted SHIP.

## Getting started
The tool uses the open-source Python framework [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/#).

First, install all the packages listed in the *requirements.txt* file by using the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, use:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

As soon as you run the command as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and the tool will open in a new tab in your default web browser.
