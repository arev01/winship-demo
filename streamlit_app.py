        A tool that estimates the performance of a ship equipped with wind powered devices in 3 simple steps: select ship type & size, choose device configuration and select a course.

        Accurate results plus a graphical output will be available in just a few seconds.

        The code works by balancing the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces of the ship. It takes into account the most important eï¬€ects of the wind powered devices to predict the ship speeds at various wind conditions.

        By determining the elapsed time around the course, a direct measure of the fuel and emission savings can be assessed.
