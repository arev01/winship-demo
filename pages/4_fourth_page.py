        The tool works by balancing the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces of the ship. It takes into account the most important eï¬€ects of the wind powered devices to predict the ship speeds at various wind conditions.

        A methodology to estimate the fuel and emission savings for a defined route (origin and destination port), ship design and speed is provided in [1].

        Due to the complexity of the problem, some approximations are made using basic ship theory:

        - For simplicity, the tool only solves one equation (movement along the longitudinal axis), assuming that the ship will naturally be balanced for all other motions.

        - Calm water resistance and hull/propeller interaction coefficients are given by Harvald [2] semi empirical method.

        - Propulsion efficiency is estimated using naval architectureâ€™s rules of thumbs.

        - Added resistance due to wind and waves is accounted for by applying a sea margin of 10-25% based on the ship route.

        - Wind powered device operation typically can be calculated through lift and drag coefficients found in literature.

         - Wind data is derived from the ERA-5 [3] database (annual average).

        - Generic models. Typical dimensions.

        - No interaction
